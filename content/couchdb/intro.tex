\section{Introduction}
This ebook was created in the context of a database Implementation lecture at the Cooperative University of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. This ebook should explain the base functionality of the document-oriented NoSQL database CouchDB. CouchDB's initial release was in year 2005.

CouchDB is licensed with the Apache License 2.0. The initial idea of CouchDB was to developed a database which is easy to manage in the most common functions. So this was the reason why the developer creates a HTTP-based REST API \parencite{Anderson.2010.Buch} document storage model with a powerful query engine."\parencite{Anderson.2010.Buch} Based on this fact it is not possible to create SQL queries for data retrieval \parencite{Scheliga.2010}.
CouchDB stores the data in JSON-Format and the query language is Javascript \parencite{MarcelWolfKeineKommentare.2016}.
