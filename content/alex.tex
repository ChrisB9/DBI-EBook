\section{Core Processes}
The MongoDB server package comes up with three main processes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item mongod
  \item mongo
  \item mongos
\end{itemize}
\textit{mongod} is the core database server. Once started, the \textit{mongod} listens by default on port 27017 for requests. It also manages the data format and performs all background operations. For administration the \textit{mondod} provides an HTTP interface witch can be reached at the localhost on port 28017 (1000 higher than the default port). \\
