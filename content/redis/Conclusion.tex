\section{Conclusion}
Key-Value Databases can save any kind of data. So, no matter if the data is a string or a picture, you can store it. Redis is one of them and has special datatypes. With these datatypes, the user can store any kind of complex data among lists or hashes. The in-memory database Redis is implemented in C and open-source. Redis is one of the fastest databases because all data is saved in-memory. Another advantage of Redis is the opportunity of replication. The Database uses a Master-Slave technology so it is possible to replicate asynchronously for the purpose of scalability or data redundancy. A big disadvantage of Redis is security. Because of the asynchronous storage Redis is not safe in the point of server failure. Another problem in this topic is the fact how Redis has implemented security. Redis is not designed for security, the user should make the whole system secure.
 
 To recap briefly Redis can fit in diverse scenarios and is very flexible. But it also has big disadvantages, so the user should check thoroughly if Redis is the best solution.
