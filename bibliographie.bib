abstract = {Second edition. Pro Apache Hadoop, Second Edition brings you up to speed on Hadoop? the framework of big data. Revised to cover Hadoop 2.0, the book covers the very latest developments such as YARN (aka MapReduce 2.0), new HDFS high-availability features, and increased scalability in the form of HDFS Federations. All the old content has been revised too, giving the latest on the ins and outs of MapReduce, cluster design, the Hadoop Distributed File System, and more. This book covers everything you need to build your first Hadoop cluster and begin analyzing and deriving value from your business and scientific data. Learn to solve big-data problems the MapReduce way, by breaking a big problem into chunks and creating small-scale solutions that can be flung across thousands upon thousands of nodes to analyze large data volumes in a short amount of wall-clock time. Learn how to let Hadoop take care of distributing and parallelizing your software?you just focus on the code; Hadoop takes care of the rest. Covers all that is new in Hadoop 2.0 Written by a professional involved in Hadoop since day one Takes you quickly to the seasoned pro level on the hottest cloud-computing framework.

Practical Guide to MongoDB covers the data model, underlying architecture, coding with Mongo Shell, and administrating the MongoDB platform, among other topics. The book also provides clear guidelines and practical examples for architecting, developing, and deploying applications using the MongoDB platform. Database developers, architects, and administrators will find useful information covering all aspects of the MongoDB platform and how to put it to use practically. The "one-size-fits-all" thinking regarding traditional RDBMSs has been challenged in the last few years by the emergence of diversified NoSQL databases. More than 120 NoSQL databases are now available in the market, and the leader by far is MongoDB. With so many companies opting for MongoDB as their NoSQL database of choice, there's a need for a practical how-to combined with expert advice for getting the most out of the software. Practical Guide to MongoDB provides readers with: A solid understanding of NoSQL databases An understanding of how to get started with MongoDB Methodical coverage of the architecture, development, and administration of MongoDB A plethora of "How to?s" enabling you to use the technology most efficiently to solve the problems you face.
